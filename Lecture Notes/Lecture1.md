### 1950s vocab

**Thinking Humanly**
- Natural Language Processing
- Knowledge Representation
- Automated Reasoning
- Machine Learning


(*Basically human. This shit impossible.*)

> [!NOTE]
> Something something Turing Test. If an AI passes Turing Test, we can say it's thinking humanly?

**Acting Humanly**
- do stuff that requires intelligence when humans do it

**Thinking Rationally**
- study of computations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act
- Logic ($A \implies B$)

**Acting Rationally**
- "intelligent agents" with "intelligent behaviour"

The Rational Agent approach

In principle, we should try to understand AI technologies through their ability to **publically display affection**:
- **P**ERCEIVE
- **D**ECIDE
- **A**CT

> [!TIP]
> Kognitiv modellering √§r intressant √§mne att koppla till AI kursens inneh√•ll. *OBS! May induce existential dread.*

> [!TIP]
> Sweden gave Descarte lung inflammation and killed him ü§ê

> [!NOTE]
> Machine learning is AI. AI is not machine learning.

### AI in Games

- collect and apply knowledge (data)
- demonstrate or imitate the ability to think and reason

<!-- The Rational Agent! (PUBLIC DISPLAYOR of AFFECTION) -->

Some factors that affect
- The design
- Engine 
- Game content

Some common AI technologies in the game-industry

- Script
- FSM
- Decision trees
- Other technologies (Planners, GOAP, etc.)

> We are more recently moving away from Decision Trees in favour of Behaviour Trees

Other AI systems
- Matchmaking/difficulty regulation
- Movement algorithms
- Procedural animation
- Collision handling systems

> [!TIP]
> Fry just needs <!-- [insert drink] and --> his all Rush mix-tape to defeat space invaders
>
> **Lurr:** Increase speed, move down and reverse direction!

Examples:
- Galaxia uses scripts
- Pac-man uses **Finite State Machine**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Game AI (AGENTS) aligns most with **1. Thinking Humanly** and **3. Acting Humanly**. If they are Rational Actors/Thinkers, they will just stomp the players which is *not* fun.
